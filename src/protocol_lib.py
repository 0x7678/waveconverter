# This file contains the code that manages the protocol definitions,
# including storing, retrieving and modifying. The defining characteristics
# for each protocol are contained in a protocol object, all of which 
# are contained in a dictionary.
# 
# This dictionary is written to a re-writeable binary file on the 
# user's machine. An initial install will have a dictionary pre-populated 
# with known protocols.
#
# The following functions are available for accessing the protocol library:
# - retrieve protocol definition from sqlite3 db
# - manually create new definition from input Python file
# - create new protocol definition (in memory)
# - return list of library elements
# - return size of library (number of protocol definitions)
# - write modified library to disk
# - export library to a text file(?)
# - 

# PC - vars to make global controls override parts of protocol def:
#   unit_error
#   glitch_filter
